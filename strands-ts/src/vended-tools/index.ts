/**
 * Barrel export for all vended tools.
 *
 * Provides a single import path for consumers who want all built-in tools:
 * ```typescript
 * import {
 *   bash,
 *   fileEditor,
 *   handoffToUser,
 *   httpRequest,
 *   notebook,
 *   sleep,
 *   webFetch,
 * } from '@strands-agents/sdk/vended-tools'
 * ```
 *
 * Note: This module requires a Node.js environment because the `bash` tool
 * imports Node built-ins (`child_process`). For browser-compatible usage,
 * import individual tools via their subpath exports
 * (e.g., `@strands-agents/sdk/vended-tools/notebook`).
